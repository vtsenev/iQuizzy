to-do

- adding a multiple choice question doesn't work properly... forgets answers of subquestions
 - when a subquestion of multiple question is answered and after that chose a new answer without uncheck an old one, then the answer of subquestion disappears
- when we chose new items from the multiple question the old one is not cleared from the DB 

for documentation purposes:

questionType = 0 - singleChoice question
questionType = 1 - multipleChoice question
questionType = 2 - question with a text answer
